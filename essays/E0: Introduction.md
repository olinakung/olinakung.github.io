When I first entered college, I did not plan on majoring in MIS. Upon learning about the opportunities and skills you can develop, I made the decision to give it a shot. Technology is advancing and becoming more prominant in everday life, making it an incredible skill to know. Through ITM 352, I hope to enhance my technical skills and incorporate them into my future career.
