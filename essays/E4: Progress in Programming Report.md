## My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
Compared to the begining of this class, I have a better understanding of various concepts covered and practiced in class. I am now able to interpret the code better and what is needed to complete certain tasks. As we continue to practice and put our skills to the test, I am more detail-oriented and attentive when writing code. This includes spelling and correct file names. I believe I am now more comfortable working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
Although I am starting to get better at writing and understanding code, I still struggle with Javascript and client-server. I am continuing to learn and reference from class lab materials, readings, peers, and online resources such as W3Schools and ChatGPT to improve my understanding of the concepts. I also need to improve my way of fixing and debugging, as I learned I struggled to understand it fully.

## I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
For most of the WODs, I learned a lot of trying things out and attempting to do it without looking at the screencast. For the most part, I was able to finish without the screencast and only looked at it to check. After completing and running through the WODs 2-3 times, I was more confident in completing the WODs alone.

## The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
For me, the labs has helped me a lot in grasping, understanding, and developing key concepts, especially the ones needed in Assignment 1. At the end of each lab, I am able to feel more comfortable with certain concepts, but still need improvement.

## I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
Assignment 1 was more difficult than I had imagined and took a lot of time. The assignment really tested me in my abilities and what we have learned so far in class. It was a valuable experience in developing my coding skills and knowledge. A great thing about assignment 1 is that it revisits some of the previous labs we have completed and WODs, but also made us search for information such as building a nicer UI. Now that I have completed assignment 1 and layed the foundation, I believe I can attempt and tacklle assignment 2 and feel a little more confident. I'm still a bit worried as we only start lab 13 as of now, but am looking forward to understanding the concepts more.

## I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:


## What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):


Be specific and give examples to support why you agree or disagree with the statement. Be honest! You are not graded on saying things you believe the instructor wants to hear. Rather you will be graded on the quality of your responses. If you have criticism of the class or instructor or suggestions that you believe will help, these are excellent things to state here. Of course insightful statements about things that work well for you are also important.
