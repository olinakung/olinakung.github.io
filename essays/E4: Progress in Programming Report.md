## My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
My programming proficiency has advanced significantly since the beginning of this class. I now possess a deeper understanding of various concepts covered and regularly practiced. I can interpret code more effectively and better discern the requirements for specific tasks, although I acknowledge there's room for improvement. Through continuous practice, I've become more meticulous and attentive to detail when writing code, including ensuring correct spelling and file naming conventions, though I still have further progress to make. I now feel more confident working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Initially, I struggled with understanding server.js, but I conquered this challenge with the help of references, manual reading, and guidance from Professor Port. Additionally, my ability to research programming-related topics has improved. Whenever I encounter uncertainty, I find valuable information on resources like W3Schools.

## I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
To enhance my programming skills, I recognize the need to focus on certain areas. While I'm making progress in writing and comprehending code, I still find Javascript and client-server interactions challenging. To address this, I'm actively learning and referencing class lab materials, readings, and seeking assistance from peers and online resources like W3Schools and ChatGPT. Additionally, I aim to refine my approach to fixing and debugging code, as I've encountered difficulties in fully grasping these processes. Furthermore, I need to improve my understanding of the proper placement of elements within code structures.

## I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
I've gained valuable insights from working on WODs, and now I can complete them without relying on the screencast. Through experimentation and trial and error, I've learned to tackle the tasks independently. Initially, I referred to the screencast occasionally for guidance but gradually gained confidence and could finish the WODs without it. Repetition and practice, often completing the WODs multiple times, have solidified my understanding and boosted my confidence in handling them solo.

## The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
The labs have been instrumental in my learning journey, aiding me in comprehending and applying key concepts, particularly those essential for Assignment 1. By the conclusion of each lab session, I feel a little more confident in my understanding of various concepts, though I recognize there is still room for improvement. While it would be beneficial to finish all lab exercises in class, completing them independently has also contributed significantly to my understanding and learning progress.

## I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
Completing Assignment 1 proved to be a challenging yet enriching experience that significantly contributed to my growth as a coder. Despite its difficulty and time-consuming nature, the assignment served as a comprehensive test of my skills and understanding of class material. It allowed me to apply concepts learned in previous labs and WODs, while also encouraging independent research to enhance aspects like UI design. Now that we have built a foundation, I feel prepared to tackle Assignment 2 with increased confidence. Although we're only beginning Lab 13, I look forward to delving deeper into the concepts to better understand and successfully complete Assignment 2. Should I encounter any confusion or require assistance, I am now comfortable seeking help when needed.

## I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
Throughout both the labs and Assignment 1, I sometimes faced confusing and unclear instructions. While I appreciate the goal of fostering critical thinking, clearer wording would have been advantageous. Though I desired to finish the labs in class, I'm thankful for the progress we've achieved, particularly considering past semesters' experiences. I believe the screencasts are beneficial for students and should be maintained.

## What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
The labs, WODs, collaboration with classmates, and asking the TA or Professor Port for help have been invaluable to my learning process. After reviewing the lab materials, references, and screencasts, I primarily gained practical knowledge and understanding by completing the Labs and WODs. Whenever I encountered difficulties, I sought assistance from classmates or the TA to understand and address issues. The progression from lab and WOD materials to Assignment 1 was particularly beneficial. Additionally, Professor Port provided assistance with some challenges I encountered.
