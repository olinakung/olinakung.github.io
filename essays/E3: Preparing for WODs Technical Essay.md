## WOD: Invoice1
Invoice1 WOD incorporated JavaScript to display an Invoice regarding a sale. Through this assignment, commenting, expressions, using template literals ( ${} ), and JavaScript skills were strengthed. 

Performing this WOD allowed me to strengthen my understanding and usage of JavaScript. Commenting, defining, and using template literals for the expressions worked well for me. Creating one row for the table and making sure it worked first was very helpful. This prevented me from not knowing where the code went wrong. However, what slowed me down was not using RegEx. I'm not strong in using RegEx so I manually changed each line of code. This could have been done faster if I had used RegEx.

To prepare for this WOD, I first read over the instructions to see what needs to be done. Then, I saw we were using JavaScript and decided to look over lab materials regarding JavaScript. Similarly to the previous WODs, I looked over my resources and searched for information that was unfamiliar to me. I also went over the WOD first without timing an attempt, just to get all the concepts down. I did not do anything different from my previous WODs as I built the habit of looking through instructions and resources first.

What I could have done to be better prepared is to practice using RegEx. If I prepared and practiced using RegEx, it would have sped up my WOD instead of manually taking time to change every single line. For the next WOD, I might try to use RegEx more. This may also help decrease any errors/mistakes.
