## WOD: BrowserHistory1

For this WOD, the final time it took me to finish was around 12 minutes. To fully understand this WOD and the materials regarding HTML, it took me an hour for my first attempt. I went over the materials learned from the resources given as I tried to attempt it on my own. I believe that taking notes on the resources was very helpful in understanding the basics and knowing what each line of code is used for. After fully understanding the content, my second attempt was around 15 minutes. I wanted to do better, so I did it a third time achieving my final time of 12 minutes. 

Through this WOD, I learned how to add hyperlinks and insert images. When putting your image link in, make sure your URL is between the quotation marks for the code to work. I also learned how to use QuickTimePlayer. 

My advice for this WOD is to take notes when going over the given resources about HTML and to learn how to use QuickTimePlayer for Mac users. QuickTimePlayer may be tricky at first, but if you navigate through the toolbar at the top, you will be able to start your recording. Also, make sure your audio is on and that you are using the right microphone, either your AirPods or Mac microphone.

## WOD: BrowserHistory2

For this WOD, my final time within two attempts was around 6 minutes. I find this WOD more straightforward regarding CSS and its requirements. Once again, I want to emphasize the importance of taking notes on the resources, such as understanding how to link Google fonts. 

I learned how to properly apply Google fonts and improved my skills regarding CSS elements. The aspect I struggled with was making the images inline with the text. I discovered that the 'float' property can be used for positioning and wrapping text around the floated item. To gain a better understanding of the 'float' property, my recommendation is to search for more information on it. A great resource to utilize is W3Schools.

My first attempt involved applying all the styles based on what I learned from the resources. After figuring it out, I watched a video tutorial to verify my solutions. Then, I made one last attempt and achieved my final time of 6 minutes. 

My advice for this WOD is to take notes, make attempts, check solutions, double-check your understanding of codes/syntax, and then re-attempt. Practicing helps build your understanding and improves your skills being tested. Don't be afraid to keep on trying. One last advice is to try and download a live server so you can see the changes without having to refresh the page. This will be very helpful.

## WOD: BrowserHistory3

For this WOD, my final time within three attempts was around 7 minutes. Of the three browser history WODs, this was the most challenging. I learned how to use the inspect element to identify my problems and find solutions.

My first attempt took about 30 minutes to complete. The middle column in Chrome would not align and was slightly larger in width compared to the other columns. I referred to the tutorial after my first attempt to identify the problem and hopefully find a solution. After watching the tutorial, I discovered that by inspecting elements, we can identify issues such as the need for padding or fixing the margin/width. At first, I could not inspect elements while using a live server. I learned that you can not inspect using a live server, so you should open a server using Node like how we do in class. In my case, padding was the issue, so I added 1px for padding. That helped a bit, but the alignment was still off, and the width became a little distorted. Then I used 'em' instead of 'px,' which solved my problem. I then searched to understand the difference between 'em,' 'rem,' and 'px.' 'Em' is relative to the parent element, which helped fix my column. My second time after understanding everything was around 12 minutes. I re-attempted to get some more practice and achieved the final time of 7 minutes.

My advice is to be careful not to miss any details, such as colons or semicolons. Another piece of advice is to experiment with the inspect element and examine the properties to help identify issues and solutions. Practice helps you become comfortable with different concepts/properties and allows you to understand the material better. Avoid using a live server for this WOD and use Node to start and server instead. Node allows you to inspect the web page.
