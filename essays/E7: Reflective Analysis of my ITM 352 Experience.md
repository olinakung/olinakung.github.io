## Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:


## Course Elements and Personal Engagement:
Crafting a professional portfolio turned out to be simpler than anticipated with the aid of a template. It's proven invaluable for documenting my journey in ITM 352 and offers a platform for others to delve into my insights. I believe it serves as a valuable resource for future ITM 352 students, offering insight into the course structure and challenges. The WODs were instrumental in my learning journey. Even though it can be tedious and one might not want to engage with it, I believe it helped me build my basic skills and foundation. Engaging in the WODs allowed me to practice coding structures and deepen my understanding of concepts. Personally, I found the quizzes less effective in preparing for labs, though they did encourage thorough reading of the lab materials, which is crucial. Through completing the labs, I learned more about codes and concepts, which led me to "RTFM" frequently. Labs were beneficial when we worked on code together in class, enhancing our understanding. However, they became stressful when we had to tackle tasks independently. Labs taught me to delve deeper into code aspects and concepts. Writing essays was a reflective exercise that underscored the progress made throughout the course. It served as a reminder of the journey taken and prompted introspection on decisions made. Assignment 1 highlighted the complexities involved in laying the foundation for a web application, while Assignment 2 delved more into the critical aspect of security. These assignments were pivotal in consolidating our learning and assessing our ability to apply knowledge independently or seek assistance when needed.

## Challenges and Achievements:


## Skill Development and Application:


## Use of AI (e.g. ChatGBT):
The use of AI helped enhance my learning and productivity when I encountered challenges. An example of how I utilized AI to boost my productivity was during Assignment 2. For instance, when implementing validation for password requirements, such as the inclusion of special characters, I would ask ChatGPT to generate an if-else statement. This streamlined the process, allowing me to quickly validate passwords. Additionally, ChatGPT facilitated my learning by providing explanations for complex concepts. Instead of searching for explanations individually, I could ask ChatGPT to clarify specific lines of code, making my learning more efficient and less time-consuming.

However, AI occasionally hindered my learning and productivity when it failed to understand the questions asked. For instance, when I requested ChatGPT to create a code to prompt a message if products were not selected, it struggled to comprehend the query. This resulted in significant time and effort spent in explaining the request to ChatGPT. In such situations, I found it more effective to refer to code provided by Professor Port's template, understand its logic, and utilize resources like W3Schools for additional clarification or research. This approach enabled me to independently troubleshoot and refine the code, ultimately overcoming the hindrance posed by AI.

## Future Implications and Professional Growth:
